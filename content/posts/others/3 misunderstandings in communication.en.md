Whether at work or in life, communication is indispensable.

In the digital age, thanks to the internet and messaging tools, communication is more efficient than in the phone era. Even so, we still face problems: unclear expression, missing context, and misunderstanding.

That is because communication has common pitfalls. Here are three common misconceptions.

## Misconception 1: Assume the other person already knows everything

In many cases, people assume the other party has the same information, so they omit details and communication breaks down.

A bad example: you want book recommendations.

You: Hi, I want to read. Recommend some books.

The other person: ... (thinking: I do not know what you like.)

They might recommend what they like, which you may not. Or they might ask for your preferences first. Either way, communication gets longer and costs more time.

This happens because you assumed they knew your preferences: genre, length, authors, and so on.

The correct way is to tell them what you want: what kind of books, approximate length, domestic or foreign authors, etc. With clearer constraints, they can recommend accurately.

In short: before communicating, the sender should consider how much background the receiver has. If the receiver knows little, provide more context. If they already know a lot, only share the missing part. This avoids wasting time on repeated or missing information.

## Misconception 2: Use language the other person cannot understand

At work, cross-industry or cross-department communication is common. You must use language the other person understands and avoid jargon.

In recent years, there are also many "internet buzzwords" in Chinese business jargon. These often cloud meaning. In many communication scenarios, such jargon is not suitable.

## Misconception 3: Expect immediate response and feedback

Have you experienced this? Someone messages you, and if you do not reply immediately, they send follow-up complaints like "why are you not replying?" Or they send a single "Are you there?" and wait.

This is a misconception that communication should get instant responses.

Even though we have many instant messaging tools (WeChat, DingTalk, Feishu), communication is still human. Tools do not replace people. You cannot expect an immediate response. If something is urgent, call or talk in person. If it is not urgent, do not just say hello and wait.

The better way is: greet, then clearly describe what you want to discuss. If a meeting or call is needed, ask about the other person's time at the end.

In short, everyone is busy, especially on workdays. Asynchronous communication is normal.

Communication is a deep topic. I am still learning, but I hope these observations help us improve together.
