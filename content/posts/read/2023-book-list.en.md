Compared with 2022, I read more books in 2023, but the range of genres narrowed. Most were literary works, and many were short story collections.

As before, I rate every book I finished in 2023 (unfinished books are not included). I also record why I read each book and my impressions. At the end, I summarize my current thoughts about reading.

Rating guide:
- 1/5: not recommended
- 2/5: not very recommended
- 3/5: ok if you have time
- 4/5: recommended
- 5/5: highly recommended

## Reading log

Books are listed in the order I read them.

### Star Moments of Mankind

- Author: Stefan Zweig (Austria-Hungary)
- Publisher: Jiangsu Phoenix Literature and Art Press
- Translator: Liang Xijiang
- Genre: biography
- Reading format: print book + WeRead
- Reason: I became interested after listening to the Culture Limited podcast. I also knew a little about it beforehand.
- Impressions: The book selects and portrays 14 historical moments that the author believes were decisive or turning points, such as the birth of the Marseillaise, Tolstoy's death, and the successful laying of a submarine cable. My memory is a bit fuzzy now and I only remember a few events. At the time I felt quite immersed. Perhaps we cannot fully empathize with these moments because they are distant from us, but if you love history, it is worth reading.
- Rating: 3/5

### Ring

- Author: Koji Suzuki (Japan)
- Publisher: Nanhai Publishing
- Translator: He Ying
- Genre: literature / science fiction
- Reading format: e-reader (z-library)
- Reason: In 2022 I saw a book recommendation video on Bilibili. It recommended Ring, the original novel behind The Ring. What shocked me was that Ring is actually sci-fi. Turning a sci-fi story into a horror film sounded unbelievable. At the time I was only curious. In 2023 I discovered the z-library collection and found Ring, downloaded it to my e-reader, and started it on a business trip. After a few pages I was completely hooked.
- Impressions: Even today it does not feel outdated. It is a rigorous sci-fi novel, and the suspenseful writing makes it very engaging. After finishing it, I wrote a review: **[Reading Notes: The Ring Is Actually a Sci-Fi Novel?](https://faweizhao26.github.io/posts/read/reading-notes-ring/)**.
- Rating: 5/5

### Ming Dynasty 1566

- Author: Liu Heping
- Publisher: Huacheng Press
- Genre: literature / historical novel
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: I kept seeing commentary on the TV series of the same name on Bilibili, and people said it was excellent. Since watching dramas takes time, I decided to read the original first. I finished it during the May Day holiday.
- Impressions: Honestly I am not very familiar with this period of history, so it is hard to judge historical accuracy. Since it is a work of fiction, it should be read as a novel. As a novel it is quite good, with dramatic plot and vivid characters.
- Rating: 4/5

### The Murder on the Links, The Kidnapped Prime Minister, The Big Four

- Author: Agatha Christie (UK)
- Publisher: New Star Press
- Genre: literature / mystery
- Reading format: e-reader (z-library)
- Reason: I planned to read several of Christie's works in 2023, so I downloaded a complete detective collection and read the books I had never read before. These three were the ones I finished last year.
- Impressions: Christie has many classics, and these three are not near the top in reputation or popularity. The Kidnapped Prime Minister is a collection of short stories.
- Rating: 3/5

### Summer, Fireworks, and My Corpse

- Author: Otsuichi (Japan)
- Publisher: Nanhai Publishing
- Translator: Lian Zixin
- Genre: literature / mystery novel
- Reading format: e-reader (z-library)
- Reason: I stumbled on it in z-library, was attracted by the title, and it was short.
- Impressions: If you treat the two stories as horror or suspense, they can be chilling. But if you insist on labeling it as detective fiction, it falls short. It is the author's debut written at age 16, so the roughness is understandable.
- Rating: 2/5

### 1587: A Year of No Significance

- Author: Huang Renyu
- Publisher: SDX Joint Publishing (Sanlian)
- Genre: history
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: After finishing Ming Dynasty 1566, I became interested in that period of history. This book was trending on WeRead, so I started it. Only after getting into it did I realize the author is a legendary historian.
- Impressions: 1587 is Huang Renyu's "macro-history" work. It starts from important figures of the Ming dynasty (Emperor Wanli, Grand Secretary Shen Shixing, former Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng, the upright official Hai Rui, and anti-pirate general Qi Jiguang) and analyzes the systemic problems that formed since the dynasty's founding, as well as the key reasons for its decline. The book is not dry; each figure is vivid and the analysis is clear. It is a very readable history book.
- Rating: 5/5

### Xian Syndrome

- Author: Zheng Zhi
- Publisher: Beijing Daily Press
- Genre: literature / short story collection
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: This book was discussed in a 2023 episode of the Culture Limited podcast. I became interested, not because of the stories, but because of its bold Northeastern dialect.
- Impressions: In recent years, Ban Yu, Shuang Xuetao, and Zheng Zhi are often called the "three swords of the Northeastern literary revival." In 2023 I finished four of their short story collections. Their styles are similar and the stories are somewhat homogenized (often about layoffs in the Northeast), so reading them in a row caused some fatigue. It is also hard to distinguish their prose styles: long paragraphs and lots of dialogue. But they are called the "three swords" for a reason. Zheng Zhi's Xian Syndrome is the most bold, with more Northeastern swear words (which I actually like). Shuang Xuetao is steady and restrained, which hits harder emotionally. Some stories in Ban Yu's Winter Swimming and Slow Walk feel less Northeastern and more abstract. Overall, the books are good and worth reading.
- Rating: 4/5

### Moses on the Plain

- Author: Shuang Xuetao
- Publisher: Beijing Daily Press
- Genre: literature / short story collection
- Reading format: WeRead
- Impressions: same as above
- Rating: 4/5

### Slow Walk, Winter Swimming

- Author: Ban Yu
- Genre: literature / short story collection
- Reading format: WeRead, e-reader (z-library)
- Impressions: same as above
- Rating: 3/5

### A Submarine in the Night

- Author: Chen Chuncheng
- Publisher: Shanghai Sanlian Bookstore
- Genre: literature / short story collection
- Reading format: e-reader (z-library)
- Reason: This book won the top prize of the 4th Blancpain-Imaginist Literature Prize and was recommended by Liang Wendao's podcast Bafen and the Culture Limited podcast.
- Impressions: This might be my favorite book of the year. The author's imagination is dazzling. The nine stories are wildly creative: a swordsmith, a brewer, the fantastical tale "Cloud Cutter" about tailoring clouds, and the sci-fi yet strange "A Mass for Dream of the Red Chamber." The stories also reflect and critique reality. For example, "A Submarine in the Night" is about education suppressing children's imagination. "Cloud Cutter" satirizes formalism and top-down thinking. "Zhufeng Temple" and "Li Yin's Lake" are stories about searching. These stories are deeply moving and resonant. My favorite is "Li Yin's Lake."
- Rating: 5/5

### In the Name of Birds and Beasts

- Author: Sun Pin
- Publisher: People's Literature Publishing House
- Genre: literature / short story collection
- Reading format: print book + WeRead
- Reason: I first learned about this book through Liang Wendao's Bafen podcast and was interested after hearing the story of the same name.
- Impressions: On WeRead I saw many low ratings, but tastes differ. I liked it. I like the author's language, especially some vivid metaphors. The three stories are unrelated but all set in the mountains, focusing on the lives of mountain people. In short, they are all stories of "searching" - on the surface, for others, but in essence, for the self and the meaning of existence.
- Rating: 4/5

### Investiture of the Gods

- Author: Chen Zhonglin (also attributed to Xu Zhonglin)
- Publisher: Yanbian People's Publishing House
- Genre: literature / classic novel
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: After watching Wuershan's film Creation of the Gods in July 2023, I wanted to reread the original.
- Impressions: This reread, after many years, gave me some new insights. I also wrote a review: **[Rereading Investiture of the Gods: Thoughts on the Film Creation of the Gods](https://faweizhao26.github.io/posts/read/reading-fengshenyanyi/)**.
- Rating: 2/5

### Chronicle of a Death Foretold

- Author: Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Colombia)
- Publisher: Nanhai Publishing
- Translator: Wei Ran
- Genre: literature / novel
- Reading format: print book
- Reason: I do not remember.
- Impressions: I do not remember either. I only remember it was short and I finished it in a couple of hours.
- Rating: 3/5

### Frankenstein

- Author: Mary Shelley (UK)
- Publisher: Yilin Press
- Translator: Sun Fali
- Genre: literature / novel
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: This book had been on my WeRead shelf for years. After hearing a podcast about it, I decided to finish it.
- Impressions: It is widely regarded as the first sci-fi novel, and it has been adapted into many films and TV shows. I remembered a movie from years ago starring a Harry Potter actor. After reading the original, my biggest impression is that it is not that "sci-fi." The core of the story is the love-hate conflict between "I" (Frankenstein) and the creature I created. The plot itself is simple, but its significance goes far beyond the text.
- Rating: 3/5

### From the Soil (Xiangtu China)

- Author: Fei Xiaotong
- Publisher: Tianjin People's Press
- Genre: sociology
- Reading format: print book
- Reason: Recommended by the "OSCAR Open Source Book Co-reading" group.
- Impressions: This is a fairly professional book, so I will borrow a general description. From the Soil is Fei Xiaotong's study of rural China. The book has 14 essays covering the rural human environment, traditional social structure, power distribution, ethics, rituals, kinship, and geography. It offers an accessible overview of the main characteristics of grassroots Chinese society. The language is smooth and easy to read.
- Rating: 4/5

### Water Margin

- Author: Shi Nai'an
- Publisher: People's Literature Publishing House (100-chapter edition)
- Genre: literature / one of the Four Great Classics
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: The last time I read Water Margin was in middle school, which was many years ago. Before rereading, I revisited the CCTV TV series and saw comments about how much it changed the plot, which made me want to read the original again in 2023.
- Impressions: The 100-chapter edition is more concise in plot. After finishing it, I gained a deeper understanding of the heroes. The story is exciting and the characters are vivid. If I have time, I may write more about Water Margin.
- Rating: 4/5

### Heroes Shed No Tears

- Author: Gu Long
- Genre: literature / wuxia
- Reading format: e-reader (z-library)
- Reason: It had been a long time since I read wuxia. I originally planned to read one Jin Yong and one Gu Long in 2023, but The Book and the Sword was too long and I only finished half. Heroes Shed No Tears is shorter, so I finished it.
- Impressions: When I was in college, I loved Gu Long's style: concise prose, cool characters, and distinctive dialogue. This time, rereading a Gu Long novel did not give me the same feeling. It felt like every character was twisted, doing twisted things and speaking twisted lines, not very grounded. But that is also his trademark. If I read Gu Long again, I might just revisit the Seven Weapons series.
- Rating: 2/5

### Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde

- Author: Robert Louis Stevenson
- Publisher: Lixin Accounting Press
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: This book had been on my WeRead shelf for a long time. It is short, so I finished it.
- Impressions: There is not much to say. The story and prose are average; the setting was novel for the author's time.
- Rating: 1/5

### Mistakes by the River

- Author: Yu Hua
- Publisher: WeRead and Dook Culture
- Genre: literature / novel
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: My wife and I watched the film adaptation in the theater. It was confusing because it did not match our expectations. At that time I had not read the original, so the movie felt like a blind box.
- Impressions: This is also a short story collection with four stories, two of which are chilling. It confirms the online joke that "Teacher Yu Hua leaves the sadness to readers and keeps the happiness for himself."
- Rating: 4/5

### Cries in the Drizzle

- Author: Yu Hua
- Publisher: Writers Publishing House
- Genre: literature / novel
- Reading format: WeRead
- Reason: This book had been on my WeRead shelf for a long time. It is also a classic Yu Hua work and did not require a membership, so I read it before Mistakes by the River.
- Impressions: The timeline is shuffled, with past and present interwoven, yet it does not feel confusing. Because it is written as "my" memory, it follows the way memory works: fragments scattered and gathered by the reader. This creates repeated text and scenes, but the repetition is not redundant. Instead, it highlights Yu Hua's masterful writing.
- Rating: 5/5

## Changes in my reading habits

In April 2023 I signed up for WeRead's annual reading challenge (read 360 days and 300 hours in one year). As a result, I used WeRead more last year. I also bought a new e-reader and started downloading e-books from z-library. Overall, I spent far more time reading e-books than print books. E-books have two main advantages: portability and better use of fragmented time. They also have downsides, like the inconvenience of taking notes and the tendency to forget what you just read.

## My new thoughts on reading

Here are some recent thoughts. They may not be right, but I will share them anyway:

- Read when you want to, and do not read when you do not want to.
- Reading is useful for some people and useless for others.
- The genre does not matter; read what you like or want to read.
- No need to show off that you read, and do not feel guilty if you read little or not at all.
- If you cannot finish a book, put it down. If you still cannot finish later, keep it on hold.
- You do not need to understand everything in a book, and you do not need to agree with everything.
- If you do not remember what the book said after finishing, that is normal.
- The format does not matter; read digital or print based on your preference.

Overall, reading is extremely subjective and there is no standard for measuring it. I wrote this article simply to organize the books I read this year. If any of them happen to interest you, then the article has value.

## 2024 reading plan

In 2024 I plan to read more books and broaden the genres again. Since I signed up for the WeRead challenge, I do not want to quit halfway, so in the first half of the year I will probably continue to focus on WeRead.

Books I plan to read in 2024 include:

- A New Biography of Su Dongpo
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
- Jian Shang
- The Selfish Gene
- Zhuangzi: A Critical Biography
- I and the Temple of Earth
