In many literary works, there is a recurring type of character: they do not change their fate through extraordinary talent or impossible luck events, but by staying consistently "lucky" as if favored by destiny. In Chinese storytelling, this type is often called a "fortunate general."

Cheng Yaojin in *Romance of Sui and Tang* and Wei Xiaobao in *The Deer and the Cauldron* are two of the most representative examples of this archetype.

They are both repeatedly lucky, yet they end up on completely different life trajectories.

## 1. Cheng Yaojin: the classic case of "the simple blessed by fortune"

When people mention Cheng Yaojin, they often recall:

"a Cheng Yaojin suddenly appears halfway"

"chaos king"

"three axe strokes"

These impressions mostly come from literary works such as *Romance of Sui and Tang* and *Shuo Tang*, plus film and TV adaptations. The historical Cheng Yaojin was less exaggerated, but the literary image is deeply rooted.

In the novel, Cheng Yaojin meets Qin Qiong in youth, then they part due to circumstance. When they reunite, Cheng gets into major trouble after robbing imperial tribute. Without Qin Qiong and Chai Shao mediating, he might have been finished very early. This was his first major "luck drop."

After that, his life repeatedly turns danger into survival:

He learns axe techniques in a dream but remembers only three and a half moves.

He secures Wagang with three axe strokes and is pushed into leadership.

He marries into a notable family and stabilizes his position.

He follows Li Shimin and eventually gains fame and rank.

Cheng Yaojin is not from a military aristocratic line, nor is he known for disciplined hard training, yet at key moments he is always "just enough" to pass.

*Romance of Sui and Tang* shapes him as:

simple

reckless

a bit blunt

kind-hearted

This matches the folk idea that "the simple are blessed by fortune."

His life feels less like personal strategic planning and more like being carried forward by the era.

## 2. Wei Xiaobao: the lucky rise of a clever realist

If Cheng Yaojin is a "straightforward fortunate general," then Wei Xiaobao is a "strategic fortunate general."

He comes from a very low background, born in a brothel and raised in street society, growing up among gambling houses, tea houses, and Jianghu's lower layers. That environment shaped him into someone who is:

quick-witted and flexible

verbally agile

good at reading people

strong at survival

His luck is not purely heaven-sent. It is the combined result of luck, social intelligence, and tactical maneuvering.

His key life nodes are almost all precise timing wins:

meeting Emperor Kangxi

helping capture Oboi

joining Tiandihui and following Chen Jinnan

maneuvering among court, Jianghu, and anti-Qing forces

surviving even after multiple identities are exposed

Wei Xiaobao looks "naturally lucky," but he is actually highly skilled at managing outcomes.

He knows:

when to play dumb

when to signal loyalty

when to yield

when to take a stance

His luck is continuously amplified by his own actions.

In the end, he retires successfully, with wealth, family, and distance from the power vortex, arguably one of the most complete endings in Jin Yong's works.

## 3. Two kinds of luck, two personality models

On the surface, Cheng Yaojin and Wei Xiaobao are both luck-driven characters. In essence, their luck comes from very different sources.

### 1) Cheng Yaojin: lifted by fate

not strong in long-term planning

limited ambition

going with the current

constant benefactors

His success resembles being "chosen by the times."

### 2) Wei Xiaobao: creating his own luck

high adaptability

good at building relationships

strong psychological insight

high risk awareness

His success is a result of precise luck management.

Put simply:

Cheng Yaojin relies on fate.

Wei Xiaobao relies on his brain.

## 4. Mixed hero and anti-hero

From a literary perspective, they also represent different types.

Cheng Yaojin: a mixed-hero figure

Wei Xiaobao: an anti-hero figure

Cheng still carries traits of traditional heroism: loyalty, courage, and blunt sincerity.

Wei Xiaobao dismantles heroism:

no obsession with martial virtue

no fixation on formal honor

no pursuit of eternal reputation

priority on self-preservation

Yet both are highly relatable because they realistically present ordinary survival intelligence.

Compared with perfect heroes, they feel closer to "real-world winners."

## 5. Luck itself is a capability

Many people reduce their success to "good fate."

But in fact:

Cheng Yaojin knows how to follow the right people.

Wei Xiaobao knows how to stay alive.

That itself is capability.

Luck never exists in isolation.

Only those who can catch luck can truly be called lucky.

## 6. Conclusion: two roads, two practical wisdoms

Cheng Yaojin's story tells us:

Without over-fighting, by riding momentum, you can still reach the finish.

Wei Xiaobao's story tells us:

Understanding rules and adapting flexibly is how you survive to the end.

One relies on heaven, one on mind.

One follows fate, one manages outcomes.

One is pushed forward, one actively finds his road.

Both are fortunate generals, but they represent two completely different success logics.

Perhaps this is exactly why these two figures endure:

They show us that life is not limited to the "hero mode."

Ordinary people can still win in their own way.
