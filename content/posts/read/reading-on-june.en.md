I finished several good books in June and want to summarize briefly.

## "Ring" (Suzuki Koji) - Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

"Ring" is the original novel behind the Japanese horror film, but it is actually science fiction. The premise is advanced and the core ideas are meaningful.

I previously wrote a short [note](https://faweizhao26.github.io/posts/read/reading-notes-ring/) about it.

## "1587: A Year of No Significance" - Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Ray Huang's classic work of macro-history. It analyzes key figures such as the Wanli Emperor, Zhang Juzheng, Hai Rui, and Qi Jiguang, revealing deep problems that led to the Ming dynasty's decline. The writing is vivid and easy to read.

## "Lychees of Chang'an" - Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Another historical novel by Ma Boyong. It focuses on a small character and reveals larger history. The book is short (about 70,000 words) and easy to finish in a few hours.

The inspiration comes from Du Mu's poem: "A single rider raises dust, the concubine smiles; no one knows it is lychees." The novel imagines how fresh lychees were transported to Chang'an and the hidden stories behind it. The book is not just about logistics; it shows the powerless position of small characters and the politics behind them.

Compared with Ma Boyong's other books, this one has fewer suspense elements, but its short length makes it a light and enjoyable read.

## "Fairy Disease" (Zheng Zhi) - Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A novella collection by Zheng Zhi, one of the "Northeast Renaissance" writers. The title story won a literary award.

I previously read his novel "Raw" and loved it. This collection shows his personal style more clearly.

Zheng Zhi is from Shenyang. The book uses strong Northeast dialect (often coarse) and a humorous tone. There is a lot of dialogue but it reads easily. The stories are diverse: some magical, some critical of superstition, some warm but helpless.

Highly recommended.
