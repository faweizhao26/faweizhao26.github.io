I do not remember when I watched the film "The Ring." I only remember Sadako crawling out of the TV. That iconic scene has been referenced in many works, mostly in a playful way.

Last year I saw a book recommendation video on Bilibili. The book was the original novel "Ring." What shocked me was that it is science fiction. Adapting a sci-fi novel into a horror film sounded unbelievable. At that time I was only curious, not interested in reading. But the fact stuck with me.

Recently I found the book in Z-Library, downloaded it to my e-reader, and opened it on a business trip. After a few pages I was hooked.

So this post is about this misunderstood sci-fi masterpiece. It contains no major spoilers.

## Sci-fi or horror?

As mentioned, is "Ring" sci-fi or horror?

After finishing it, I can confidently say it is sci-fi. But the plot, the writing style, and the fame of the film make many readers think it is horror or suspense.

The series has four parts. The first is the basis for the film, the second and third continue the story, and the fourth fills missing pieces, making the story complete.

In style, the first book leans toward horror and suspense. The core is the protagonist investigating a death videotape and discovering supernatural power (Sadako's ghost), but failing to solve it. The author pulls you along as Asakawa deciphers the mystery while facing constant danger. If you accept the rule that those who watch the tape die in seven days, you are fully drawn in.

The second book adds more sci-fi but still emphasizes mystery. It is like a detective novel, revealing secrets step by step. Yet the final events are so shocking that you may still wonder if it is horror. Some elements are hard to explain scientifically and feel almost metaphysical.

The third book is different. It continues the story but finally becomes strongly sci-fi. It also explains the title "Ring." The twist is jaw-dropping. Some earlier elements still have no clear explanation, but that is part of the author's setup.

## What is the core?

The core is not horror or supernatural power.

The story revolves around digital life, somewhat like the digital being in The Wandering Earth 2, but with a different setup. The digital life in "Ring" lives almost like humans but cannot contact the real world. It also hints at AI awakening: a digital being realizes the world is虚幻, finds a loophole, and connects to reality. This resembles Westworld or The Thirteenth Floor, and the relationship between virtual and real is closest to The Matrix.

Ultimately, the series explores life itself: how life begins, reproduces, and evolves. Even "simple" life like viruses has mysteries. Viruses replicate, and errors in replication cause mutations. This is the basis of biodiversity. If DNA were identical, life would become uniform and vulnerable to extinction.

In the end, humanity evolves because "humans can endure anything except loneliness."

## Is it worth reading?

These are my personal reflections, without borrowing online interpretations. The book is not widely famous, perhaps because of the film. If I were the author, I would be unhappy that a sci-fi work was adapted into a shallow horror film and that the original never reached its deserved reputation.

If you like sci-fi and mystery, it is worth reading. The plot is tight and engaging. If you are curious about the original behind the film, read it, but do not stop at book one. At least read the first three. Better yet, read all four. In short, it is worth it.
