I have always had some ideas about how to read books. Even if I do not always follow them, I want to write them down in case they help others.

Before reading a book, what preparations do you make?

Do you study the author's life? The context of the book? Make a reading plan?

In my mind, reading a book can follow these steps.

## 1. Clarify the purpose

We read for a reason; we rarely read purely for reading itself.

Common purposes include:
- improve skills
- seek knowledge
- broaden horizons
- cultivate taste
- meet emotional needs
- simply pass time

Even in the information age, books remain an important source of knowledge.

## 2. Learn about the author and the background

Some books are written to express the author's ideas, such as classics.

Knowing the author's life and the creation background helps you understand the book's ideas and expression more efficiently.

It also broadens your horizons and helps you discover other works worth reading.

## 3. Choose a reading medium

We are luckier than people in the past because we can read at lower cost.

Besides paper books, we can read through apps or online.

So choose a medium: buy a physical book, borrow from a library, read online, or use an app.

## 4. Make a reading plan

The first few steps are easy. This one is harder.

Reading takes time, and adults have limited free time, plus short videos and games compete for attention. A realistic plan is difficult but necessary.

A simple approach is to plan by time and pages/chapters: read for a set time each day or a set number of pages.

## 5. Take notes

I used to take notes, writing down good sentences and key ideas. In recent years I have had less time and read more e-books, so I paused this habit.

But taking notes is valuable: it strengthens memory and avoids "forgetting how to write." When you revisit notes, you may gain new insights.

## 6. Write reflections

After finishing a book, you can write what you felt and learned.

There is no fixed template. It is all personal understanding. I have written some literary reflections on my public account; they are a form of reading reflection.

These steps should work for many books. If they are useful, feel free to try them.
