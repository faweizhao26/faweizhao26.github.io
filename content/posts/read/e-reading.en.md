Thanks to smartphones and smart devices, e-reading has become popular and is the main reading method for many people.

Compared with paper books, e-reading has many advantages: portability, more free resources, and more options.

When I was in high school, even without smartphones, some classmates used MP4 devices to read web novels.

In college I started reading e-books on a Nokia phone. There were already reading apps and many free e-books online, but paper books were still my main choice.

After smartphones appeared, I tried many apps: QQ Reading, iReader, Panda Reading, JD Reading, WeChat Reading, and more. I also used built-in apps like Apple Books.

Among these, my favorite and longest-used is WeChat Reading. Its advantages:

1. Many free resources
2. Reading time can be exchanged for trial cards or coins to buy books
3. Import local files (with limits)
4. Reading stats and badges that show achievements
5. Reading groups that help you earn rewards

Since 2019, WeChat Reading has been my main channel for e-books. From 2021 onward, I bought two e-readers, partly because they came with WeChat Reading pre-installed.

Compared with phones, tablets, and computers, e-readers have two main advantages:

1. E-ink screens are easier on the eyes
2. They are focused on reading, without entertainment apps, so it is easier to stay focused

Besides the advantages above, WeChat Reading also offers many challenges: 7-day, 21-day, 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day challenges.

A challenge requires reading enough time and days within a period. For example, the 365-day challenge requires 300 hours and 300 days within 365 days. The rewards are generous: 365 days of membership and 500 book coins. The entry fee is 50 RMB.

Last month, my 365-day challenge ended. It started on World Book Day last year.

I completed the challenge and received the reward.

Surprisingly, I did not feel excited. I felt tired and relieved. After finishing, my reading time dropped sharply; I finished only one book in a month.

This was expected. Reading should not be a task. It is an interest. When interest turns into a task, it can weaken or even become dislike.

So if you do not have strong enthusiasm and persistence, I do not recommend joining these challenges.

Of course, e-reading has downsides. Some people feel it is harder to remember compared with paper books. Page flipping is inconvenient. Some people are not used to e-notes and bookmarks.

Although e-reading is my main method now, I am trying to read more paper books. After all, I have bought over a hundred books and read only a small fraction.
